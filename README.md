# FireCircuit

Quick sketch for the [Adafruit Circuit Playground](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3000) based on the
[Circuit Playground Jack-o'-Lantern](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuit-playground-jack-o-lantern) tutorial.

Basically added the following;
* Turn On/Off with the slide swich
* Doubled up the animation to make it a bit more flickery 
* Use the capacitive touch to change animation when touching the pumpkin (hopefully)
* Turn off the animations if the light level is too high, or rather only turn the animation on in the dark
